# Malware-Detection

There are some basic techniques and tools that can be used in Java to detect known malware signatures or behaviors. One common approach is to use an antivirus library that provides a database of known malware signatures and can scan files for those signatures. 

In this example, I started by specifying the path to the file to scan and reading its content into a byte array. I used the scanFile method to scan the file content for malware using the ClamAVClient library. The scanFile method connects to a ClamAV server at the specified address and port, sends the file content to the server for scanning, and receives the scan result. The main method then checks the scan result to determine if the file contains malware.
